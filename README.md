### Discord bot

**TODO: Search and selection of providers**

## Usage
Before usage, a new Discord application has to be created, as shown in the [instructions](http://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html), where the private key is aquired. The key is used when running the application for authentication. It has to be placed into a file next to the bot file, or directly in the client.run command.
